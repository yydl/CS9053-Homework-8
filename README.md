CS9053-Homework-8 is a homework project. It uses Java Collections to schedule jobs using one of two algorithms:

 - `LambdaScheduler` schedules jobs on a container such that the number of non-overlapping jobs is maximized
 - `LambdaWeightedScheduler` schedules jobs on a container such that the weight (price) of non-overlapping jobs is maximized
